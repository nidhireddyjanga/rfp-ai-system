RFP AI System – Multi-Agent Workflow for B2B Tender Automation

This project is our group attempt at simplifying the slow, manual RFP response process used in many industrial companies (like cable manufacturers, FMEG, and wiring OEMs).
Instead of humans passing spreadsheets and PDFs around, we built a small multi-agent system that reads RFPs, matches products, estimates pricing, and prepares structured outputs.

It’s not meant to be perfect or “fully production-level,” but it covers most of the bottlenecks we found during research and was a fun challenge to work on.


🧠 Agent Overview

We built four simple agents, each doing one specific step in the RFP chain.

1. Sales Agent (RFP Discovery & Shortlisting)

What it does:

Pretends to “scan” URLs (we simulated this with sample files)

Picks RFPs due within the next 3 months

Summarizes the RFP for downstream agents

Hands off the selected RFP to the Main Orchestrator

This agent acts like a basic filter so the team isn’t drowning in low-priority RFPs.


2. Technical Agent (Spec Matching & SKU Recommendation)

What it does:

Reads the RFP scope and specs

Compares them to our internal product database (CSV)

Scores products using a simple match metric:

Voltage (exact match)

Conductor material

Insulation thickness (±20% tolerance)

Picks top 3 matching SKUs

Selects the "Top SKU" per item for pricing

Outputs a detailed technical_reco.json

This agent basically reduces the time engineers spend looking through product tables.



3. Pricing Agent (Developed by: Ujjwal Moolchandani)

This was the trickiest part because pricing usually depends on several moving parts.

What the Pricing Agent actually computes:

Material cost (SKU price × quantity)

Test cost (per-test pricing, quantity defaults to 1 if not given)

Margin (default 12%)

GST (default 18%)

Fixed overhead

Final cost per item

Grand total per RFP

It also produces a bunch of helpful warnings — not to be annoying, but because missing SKUs or test prices can cause silent errors later.



Outputs generated:

pricing_output_RFP001.json
pricing_output_RFP002.json
pricing_output_RFP003.json
pricing_output_combined.json


The Pricing Agent expects technical_reco.json already generated by the Technical Agent.



4. Main Orchestrator (Glue Logic)

Depending on how the project is run, this file ties everything together:

Sales → Technical → Pricing → Final Response


This simulates how a real internal workflow might behave inside a company.

📂 Data Files

All input data lives in data/:

products.csv → cable SKUs + specs

product_pricing.csv → SKU → price

test_pricing.csv → test → price

rfps/*.json → sample RFPs

validate_csv.py → small script to sanity-check CSV files

We kept everything lightweight so anyone on the team could update/test it quickly.

▶️ How to Run Everything (Simple Version)
1. Run Technical Agent (creates technical_reco.json)
python agents/technical_agent.py


Make sure environment variables point to the right folders if needed.

2. Run Pricing Agent (generates final pricing outputs)
python agents/pricing_agent.py


And that's basically it — outputs appear in the project root.

⚠️ Notes & Gotchas (less formal but important)

CSV formatting matters more than we expected — hence the validator.

If an SKU/test isn't found, the Pricing Agent will warn you instead of silently failing.

Technical Agent assumes that RFP specs use consistent naming (e.g., “1.1kV”, “Copper”).

Quantity is not provided in our sample RFPs → Pricing Agent defaults it to 1.

Margin/GST/overhead are adjustable inside the Pricing Agent file — we kept them simple.

💬 Final Thoughts

This project helped us understand the flow of B2B RFP operations and also gave us a chance to simulate a real agent-based workflow. It’s far from a commercial-grade system, but it captures the essence of the problem and shows how AI agents can lighten repetitive tasks.
